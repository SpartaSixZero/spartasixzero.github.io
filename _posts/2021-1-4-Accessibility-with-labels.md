title: Accessibility with labels
---

According to MDN: _"Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11yâ€”as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way."_

`<label>` elements are a must have in every web page to make it more accessible. Every `<input>` element should have a matching `<label>` element. When you add a `<label>` element and link it with an `<input>` element, you enable 2 things:

1. If the user is using a screen reader, if the user focuses on the `<input>` element, the screen reader will now read the content of the `<label>`. This greatly improves accessibility for those with a vision disability.
1. If you click the `<label>` element, it will actually focus the `<input>` element. This provides a greater hit area making it easier to use for those with a touch-screen device.

Accessibility or A11y, should be included in the design of every project from the start.
