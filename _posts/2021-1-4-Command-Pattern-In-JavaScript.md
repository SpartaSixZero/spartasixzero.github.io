title: Command Pattern in JavaScript
---

While reading the brilliant book by Addy Osmani, [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/), I've ran into the Command Pattern. Before any further reading, I've turned to the book, [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612). After reading the chapter on Command Pattern, it reminded me a lot of Redux.js and how its actions work. Actions in Redux are just plain old JavaScript objects that contains a "command" and optional data. I was so certain they were related that I googled "Command Pattern and Redux" and found this article titled [Redux and The Command Pattern](https://medium.com/@abhiaiyer/the-command-pattern-c51292e22ea7)
It's fascinating how even new technology created in the last few years still have roots in tried and true design patterns. Just reinforces the fact that every software developer should have a solid understanding of design patterns.
