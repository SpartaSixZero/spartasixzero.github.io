Full stack software engineer with a passion for front-end development. I have 7+ years of experience in developing enterprise web applications.

My current focus is front-end development using React and Redux. I have a strong affinity for React because I love the simple component based design which makes UI code very modular and easy to maintain and scale. Redux made a lot of sense to me because it has its roots in functional programming and that's another thing that I love to practice as well as preach.

I enjoy mentoring other developers and spreading the word on code maintainability and re-usability. I strongly believe that good code is simple code that can be easily understood.
